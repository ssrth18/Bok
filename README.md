# Little Space — installable web app

## Install on your device
Host this folder on any HTTPS site (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Vercel), then open it:
- **Chrome / Edge (desktop & Android):** use Chrome menu → Install app (or the install icon in the address bar).
- **iPhone / iPad (Safari):** Share → Add to Home Screen.

## Run locally
    python3 -m http.server 8080   # then open http://localhost:8080

Notes: service workers need HTTPS or localhost; opening index.html via file:// still works but isn't installable.
